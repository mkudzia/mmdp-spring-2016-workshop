# Git and GitHub for Librarians

## Intro
Hi, I'm Megan! Today we're talking about Git and GitHub for Librarians (and Archivists, and Museum folk, etc.). You can use this outline to follow along with the workshop materials, and to refer back to in the future.

Specifically, here you'll find instructions for doing some basic work with Git or GitHub. So buckle in and let's get started :)

## Git
### Getting started:
Mac OS:
1) Open Launchpad OR open a finder window and go to "Applications"
2) Look for the program "Terminal" -- in Launchpad it's probably under "Other," in Finder > Applications it'll be under "Utilities"
3)

Windows:
1) Open the Start menu and type `git` into the prompt; choose "Git Bash" from the options that appear
2) When "programs" comes up in the  menu, double-click to open Git Bash

## GitHub
