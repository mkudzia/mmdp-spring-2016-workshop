# Git and GitHub for Librarians

## Intro
Hi, I'm Megan! Today we're talking about Git and GitHub for Librarians (and Archivists, and Museum folk, etc.). You can use this outline to follow along with the workshop materials, and to refer back to in the future.

Specifically, here you'll find instructions for doing some basic work with Git or GitHub. So buckle in and let's get started :)

## Git
### Getting started: Opening the command line
#### Mac OS:
1. Open Launchpad OR open a finder window and go to "Applications"
2. Look for the program "Terminal" -- in Launchpad it's probably under "Other," in Finder > Applications it'll be under "Utilities"

#### Windows:
1. Open the Start menu and type `cmd` into the prompt; choose "cmd" from the options that appear

### Git Command Line Basics
Type the part of the text `that looks like this` for each command to try it out.

#### Mac OS:
1. Figure out what folder you're in: `pwd`
2. Find out what's in that folder: `ls`
3. Leave the Terminal for a moment and create a new folder on the Desktop as you normally would
4. Move into that folder using Terminal:
	* Click and drag the folder into your command line window
	* Use the back arrow to get to the beginning of the line and type `cd`
	* It should look like: `cd path/to/your/file`
5. Make a new folder inside that folder using the command line: `mkdir foldername.txt` *no spaces in the folder name!*
6. Make a new file: `touch filename.txt`

#### Windows:
1. Figure out what folder you're in: `echo %cd%`
2. Find out what's in that folder: `dir`
2. Leave the command prompt for a moment and create a new folder on the Desktop as you normally would
4. Move into that folder using cmd:
	* Change the current directory to the Desktop: `cd Desktop`
	* See what's on your Desktop: `dir`
	* Move into the right folder: `cd path\to\your\file`
5. Make a new folder inside that folder: `mkdir foldername` *no spaces in the folder name!*
6. Make a new file: `fsutil file createnew filename.txt 0`
